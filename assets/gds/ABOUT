The Intel 4004 was the first commercial microprocessor (1971). It’s a 4-bit CPU with ~2,300 transistors.
Peter Monta and collaborators recreated the 4004 layout. This GDSII file (4004.gds) is referenced in Purdue’s GDSII tools repo

Layer 1 is a diffusion layer
Layer 3 and 5 are vias (black)
Layer 4 is an insulator (thin)
Layer 6 are electrodes and interconnects
